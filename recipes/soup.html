  <h3>A chicken noodle soup recipe that's a very easy, very good substitute for when you don't have time to make your soup totally from scratch.</h3>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Onions and Celery: In the first step of this chicken noodle soup recipe, diced onions and chopped celery are cooked in butter until they're aromatic and tender.</li>
    <li>Broth: This chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and vegetable broths. If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just use one or the other.</li>
    <li>Chicken: Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken, you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut.</li>
    <li>Noodles: Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too long will make them mushy.</li>
    <li>Carrots: Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the end of cooking so they stay crisp. You can add them to the saut√©ed vegetables at the beginning if you like your carrots tender.</li>
    <li>Basil and Oregano: Dried basil and oregano lend warm, earthy flavor to this chicken noodle soup recipe.</li>  
  </ul>
